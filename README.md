# Pharmacies_Management_System
Purpose
Many people don't know if the medicine is available in pharmacies or not, so they 
waste their time and effort trying to reach many pharmacies to ask about the 
specific medicine. The goal of this project is to provide a system that interconnect 
many pharmacies and list all available medicines within each pharmacy to 
facilitate searching for all medicines.
